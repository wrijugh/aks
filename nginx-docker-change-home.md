# How to Change NGINX Homepage and Build a Docker Image

Certainly! To create a **Dockerfile** for an **Nginx** container and customize the default homepage, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Dockerfile**:
    - Start by creating a new file named `Dockerfile` (with no file extension) in your desired directory.
    - Open the `Dockerfile` in a text editor.

2. **Specify the base image**:
    - In your `Dockerfile`, use the `nginx:latest` image as the base image. This image provides a pre-configured Nginx server.
    - Add the following line at the beginning of your `Dockerfile`:
        ```Dockerfile
        FROM nginx:latest
        ```

3. **Set the working directory**:
    - Specify the working directory within the container where your custom HTML file will be placed.
    - Add the following line after the `FROM` statement:
        ```Dockerfile
        WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html
        ```

4. **Copy your custom HTML file**:
    - Assuming you have an `index.html` file (or any other HTML file) that you want to use as your homepage, copy it into the `/usr/share/nginx/html` directory within the container.
    - Add the following line to your `Dockerfile`:
        ```Dockerfile
        COPY welcome.html index.html
        ```

5. **Build the Docker image**:
    - Open a terminal or command prompt in the same directory as your `Dockerfile`.
    - Run the following command to build your Docker image (replace `html_nginx` with your desired image name):
        ```bash
        docker image build -t html_nginx .
        ```

6. **Run the container**:
    - Start a container using the newly created image:
        ```bash
        docker container run -p 80:80 --rm html_nginx
        ```
    - Access your custom homepage by visiting `http://localhost:80` in your web browser.

Remember that the default Nginx configuration loads the `index.html` file from the `/usr/share/nginx/html` directory. By copying your `welcome.html` as `index.html`, you'll see your desired output when accessing the server. If you want to make this change more permanent, consider creating a custom Docker image with an updated configuration¬π¬≤. Happy Dockerizing! üê≥üöÄ
